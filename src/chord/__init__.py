Chord Package

This package contains modules and classes for implementing and interacting with 
a Chord Distributed Hash Table (DHT) network.



### Key Changes:
1. **File Organization**:
   - Added a section explaining how the files are split between the `API` folder and the `Controller`.
   - Clarified the roles of the `API` folder (core logic) and the `Controller` (web interface for nodes).

2. **Maintained Existing Content**:
   - Retained the explanation of the Chord DHT benefits and the Docker-Compose setup instructions.

3. **Improved Clarity**:
   - Highlighted the role of the `Controller` in enabling SuperDARN requests and external interactions.

Let me know if you need further refinements!### Key Changes:
